# Week 11 Headstarter Accelerator Project 11 Popreel: TikTok Clone

## Project statemant
PopReel: TikTok Clone.
For this project, you are tasked with building a platform where users can create and share short-form video content, like TikTok.


For this project, imagine you are an engineer at a social media startup. You are tasked with building out a platform where users can create, share, and discover short-form video content, just like TikTok.

**Project Requirements:**

- Build a full-stack web app where users can post short-form videos and view videos from others in a feed
- Allow users to like and comment on videos, and let them share and favorite videos
- Implement a smart recommendation system for what videos a user sees on their feed

**Challenges:**

- Implement a moderation system to prevent users from uploading inappropriate content
- Make your recommendation system adaptive based on the user's most recent activity
- Ensure minimal latency in the video uploads and playback

## App Setup (localhost)

```
git clone https://github.com/AslauAlexandru/popreel-tiktok-clone
cd popreel-tiktok-clone
cp .env.example .env
```


You'll have to set up an AppWrite account, and then add all of the details into your .env file.

For example .env.example looks like:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_URL='https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1'
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID=''

NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION_ID_PROFILE=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION_ID_POST=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION_ID_LIKE=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION_ID_COMMENT=''

NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME="tiktok-clone"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_ID=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLACEHOLDER_DEAFULT_IMAGE_ID=''

```
